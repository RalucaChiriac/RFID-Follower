# RFID Follower

### How it works?

The RFID-Follower robot is an automated system that transports objects within factories or other production-oriented spaces. It follows a line drawn on the floor using infrared sensors and performs various tasks such as loading and unloading, based on information read from RFID cards placed along the route.

### What is its purpose?

The goal of this robot is to optimize logistics processes in production spaces, reducing the time spent manually handling objects and minimizing errors. It is a solution that improves work efficiency and safety.

### What was the inpiration?

I started from the need to automate internal transport in small or medium-sized factories, where the costs of a complex industrial solution are difficult to justify. The idea was to create a simple, affordable and customizable device that would meet the specific needs of users.

### Why it's useful?

RFID-Follower is useful for others because it offers an efficient, economical and easy-to-implement solution in various industrial fields. For me, it represents an opportunity to put into practice the knowledge of robotics, electronics and programming, contributing to the development of technologies applied in the real world.
